This is the list of known issues with Tali Forth ALPHA 004. Note that this is an ALPHA release of an incomplete program, so there are probably going to be more bugs than working routines. See the .ods spreadsheet for a list of supported instructions, or type WORDS once Tali Forth is running. 


MAJOR KNOWN PROBLEMS

- not all ANSI core instructions coded yet (see TODO.txt). Most notable of these are +LOOP, VALUE, and ?DO

- LOOP has pre-ANSI behavior: Where as 0 0 DO I . LOOP produces nothing in Tali Forth and Fig-Forth, it runs through the whole range of numbers with ANSI Forth.


MINOR KNOW PROBLEMS

Currenty too many to count. Seriously, this is an ALPHA release.
