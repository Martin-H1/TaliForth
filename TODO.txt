=== LONGER TERM ===

- use internal version of POSTPONE (l_postpoint) to clean up code
- use LITERAL (l_lit) to clean up code (compare ['] routine)
- include interrupts in kernel
- cut kernel further down to size
- remove .invokes, edit MACRO file 
- simplify high-level word definitions
- check code for use of BIT 
- See if S" conforms to Gforth usage
