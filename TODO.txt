Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
This version: 20. Jan 2015

=== SHORT TERM === 

List of words that still need to be coded

?DO 
2>R (SWAP >R >R)
2R> (R> R> SWAP)
2R@ (R> R> 2DUP >R >R SWAP)
LEAVE 
MOVE 
NEXTNAME (not ANSI, from gforth) 
RECURSE
WORD

Completing all words on this list will trigger BETA status


=== LONGER TERM ===

- use internal version of POSTPONE (l_postpo_int) to clean up code
- simplify high-level word definitions
- see if we can do without (..) helper functions of words
- check code for use of BIT 
- rewrite ." for more efficient code
