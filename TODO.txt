=== SHORT TERM === 

List of words that still need to be coded

?DO 
LEAVE 
MOVE 
RECURSE

Completing all words on this list will trigger BETA status. This list is subject to change. 


=== LONGER TERM ===

- use internal version of POSTPONE (l_postpo_int) to clean up code
- simplify high-level word definitions
- see if we can do without the various "(..)" helper functions of words
- check code for use of BIT 
- unroll macros for better readability of text
