This version: 17. Jan 2015

=== SHORT TERM === 

List of words that still need to be coded

?
?DO 
2R> 
2>R 
ABORT" 
LEAVE 
MOVE 
NEXTNAME (not ANSI, from gforth) 
WORD

Completing all words on this list will trigger BETA status

=== LONGER TERM ===

- use internal version of POSTPONE (l_postpoint) to clean up code
- use LITERAL (l_lit) to clean up code (compare ['] routine)
- simplify high-level word definitions
- check code for use of BIT 
- See if S" conforms to Gforth usage (doesn't look like it)
